# Hi, I'm Mason!
I'm a software engineer and a musician.

#
I graduated from **Wittenberg University** in Springfield, Ohio in 2024 with a BA in Computer Science and a BA in Music.

While studying, I took a particular interest in quality control, design, and software engineering processes.
I'm hoping to become a project manager or lead software engineer in the future!

#
### Notable Projects
#### Keyence IM Interface (`private`)
API and data processing system used to link two disparate processes. Cuts manual data-entry out of key workflows and improves accuracy.
#### Lot Control Management System (`private`)
Ongoing project aimed to design and deploy a new tracking system for Lot (manufacturing) data.
Utilizes handheld scanners to cut out manual data entry and leverages a custom-design software to interface with new Lot database.
