   <h2>Hi, I'm Mason!</h2>
   <h4>I'm a software engineer and a musician.</h4>
   <h4>I graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio in 2024 with a BA in Computer Science and a BA in Music.</h4>
   <p>
      While studying, I took a particular interest in quality control, design, and software engineering processes.
      I'm hoping to become a project manager or lead software engineer in the future!

         <p>
LotCoM is a new, all-encompasing system that enables digital lot-tracing data management at YNA. With LotCoM, YNA is able to store and interact with lot-tracing data from every in-house production process. Starting at the raw material stage, LotCoM creates long-form chains of data that trace information from each process station.
