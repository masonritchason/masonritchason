Hi, I'm Mason!

I'm a contracted software engineer and a Master's student at the University of Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. 

I graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio in 2024 with a BA in Computer Science and a BA in Music.

While studying, I took a particular interest in quality control, design, and software engineering processes.
I'm hoping to become a project manager or lead software engineer in the future!

Previously:
Intern with Yamada North America, INC. in their Quality Assurance department. 
Worked with digital document management solutions to improve manufacturing workflows.
Programmed in Python and worked with APIs and JSON.

On the side, I'm a professional musician and a composer!
