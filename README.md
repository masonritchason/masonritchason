Hi, I'm Mason!

I currently work as an Intern with Yamada North America, INC. in their Quality Assurance department. 
I work with their digital document management solutions to improve manufacturing workflows.
Currently, I'm programming in Python and working with lots of JSON for on-network applications.

I'm learning a lot about network applications and web API functions.

On the side, I'm a professional musician and a composer!
